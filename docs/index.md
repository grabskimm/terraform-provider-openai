# openai Provider

The OpenAI provider allows you to configure resources and data sources for your OpenAI organization. It uses internal APIs, so breaking changes are expected.

Unfortunately, OpenAI's API keys do not allow some functionalities. Therefore, we need to obtain an OpenAI session key from the `Authorization` header of any requests to `https://api.openai.com/dashboard/*`. Log in to https://platform.openai.com, use Inspect Element to look for any requests to `https://api.openai.com/dashboard/*`, and grab the `Authorization` header value.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "openai" {
  session_key = "sess-0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```
